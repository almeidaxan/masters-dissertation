# Alexandre Master's Dissertation Scripts & Data

In this repo you can find almost all scripts and data that were used in my Master's dissertation.

Large files (such as *rasters*) were not included, as they can be easily downloaded by means of the developed tools found in `/Python/`, or any other preferred way.

Some specific *shapes* were also not included, as they comprise confidential information.
